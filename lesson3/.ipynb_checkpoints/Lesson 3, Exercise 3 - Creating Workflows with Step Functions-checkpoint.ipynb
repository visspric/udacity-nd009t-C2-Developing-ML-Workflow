    "In the prior exercises, we've been working with many small services. This can be overwhelming for a data scientist that wants to establish a consistent methodology for handling data. Step Functions is an orchestration service that can allow us to utilize SageMaker in a methodical and consistent way. Step Functions also integrates with Lambda, which can allow us to potentially automate our entire machine learning pipeline end-to-end. Let's get a handle on what a 'step' in a step function looks like.\n",
